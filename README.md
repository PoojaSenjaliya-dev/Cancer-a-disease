# **Cancer a Disease in Europ**
This dataset is a comprehensive collection of data relating to individuals diagnosed with lung cancer. Each row focuses on a single patient, providing demographic details as well as health-related variables. The geographical distribution is limited to European countries. The diagnosis date for all patients ranges from June of 2014 to June of 2024.

------------

## Key Questions and Objectives:

This analysis attempts to answer the following questions:

● Which health indicators are most strongly associated with lung cancer survival?

● Which countries in the European Union have the highest survival rate of lung cancer? why might some countries' survival rates be ahead of others?

● Can a predictive model be developed to determine an individual's likelihood of surviving lung cancer based on health indicators, treatment, and/or demographic variables?

--------------

## Tools Used:

● Python(Jupyter): Scripts were written in Jupyter notebook to conduct data cleaning, data wrangling, and various analyses to uncover relationships and patterns within the data.

● Tableau Public: Tableau was utilised to illustrate and report on findings made throughout the project. Key insights, limitations, and future steps have been detaled in the conclusion.

● Excel: On occasion, Excel was utilised to wrangle the data and simplify the process of creating certain visualisations in Tableau.
